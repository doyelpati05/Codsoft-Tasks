# 🏧 ATM Interface

A console-based **ATM simulation** program built using *Java*. This project was developed as **Task 3** of my internship with **CodSoft**.

It mimics real-life ATM operations like withdrawing, depositing, and balance checking — all with proper validations and intuitive feedback for the user.
